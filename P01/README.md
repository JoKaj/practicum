Practicum 1
===========

Learning objectives:

  - Familiarize with the programming environment (Python and DataJoy)
  - Variable transformation (normalization, binarization, discretization)
  - Proximity calculations
  - Simple plotting


See the document on itslearning about the programming environment, etc.

## Task 1. Variable transformation: normalization by scaling between 0 and 1
 
  - Generate a random value that is the sum of rolling two six-sided dice.
  - Create a vector with n random values.
  - Plot the distribution of the values on a histogram.
  - Normalize the values between 0 and 1 using Min-Max normalization.
  - Plot the distribution of the normalized values on a histogram.
